## Creating a Character

### Attributes

Assign 100 points across your attributes, no attribute should be lower than 8 or higher than 18.

Alternatively, you can distribute the values (3,4,5,6,7,8) among Body, Mind, Social, Power,
Finesse and Resilience, and then sum up for each attribute -- finally adding +1 to one
single attribute.

**Example:** Po 6, Fi 5, Re 4, Bo 8, Mi 7, So 3, Tr +1

* Physique (Ph) = 14
* Swiftness (Sw) = 13
* Toughness (To) = 12
* Intelligence (In) = 13
* Awareness (Aw) = 12
* Determination (De) = 11
* Presence (Pr) = 9
* Fellowship (Fe) = 8
* Tranquility (Tr) = 8

**Passive Abilities:**

* Reaction = 26
* Stamina = 24
* Perception = 24
* Willpower = 22
* Composure = 16

**Secondary Scores:**

* Initiative = 2d6
* Movement = 7
* Actions = 2

### Ancestry, Upbringing and Culture

TBD.

### Skills

You have X points to buy skills.

* Proficiency (ie. base value) in a new skill costs 5 points.
* each +5 improvement of a skill costs 2 points.

## Making Tests

The test threshold is the skill value plus difficulty modifier(s).
Roll d100 equal to or less than the threshold for success, higher is failure.

| Difficulty   | Modifier | Time Taken             | Ranged Attacks |
|:-------------|:--------:|:-----------------------|:---------------|
| Very Easy    |   +60%   | Ten times normal time  |         |
| Easy         |   +40%   | Five times normal time | Touch   |
| Simple       |   +20%   | Double normal time     | Reach   |
| Routine      |    +0%   | Normal time            | Near    |
| Difficult    |   –20%   | --                     | Far     |
| Hard         |   –40%   | Half normal time       | Long    |
| Very Hard    |   –60%   | --                     | Extreme |
| Formidable   |   –80%   | Almost instantly       |         |

* A pair (11,22,...,99,00) is a critical indicator.
* A "00" is always a critical fumble.
* if successful, the positive effect level (if needed) is equal to the "tens" of the roll.
* if unsuccessful, the negative effect level (if needed) is equal to the "tens" of the roll minus the "tens" of the threshold.

### Contests

Each side make its roll, the side with the "more positive" effect level wins.

* On a tie compare skills.
* On again a tie GM decides

The final effect level of a contest is the difference of the effect levels.

## Combat

A combat round has 6 seconds length.

### Initiative and Action Order

Roll Initiative Scores, highest result (tick) acts first, additional actions start 2 ticks later each.

This action order usually persists for the entire encounter, unless the gm decides otherwise.

### Melee or Skirmishing Combat Contest

Roll your combat skill as you would for a contest.

If the defender is not in the position to actively defend, he needs to substitute Reaction instead.

If the defender is not in the position to passively defend (restrained), his effect level is zero.

Note: this could mean that an unlucky attacker can damage itself even given a restrained defender.

### Ranged Attack Tests

Roll your combat skill as you would for a test, using the applicable range modifiers from the table.

### Weapons and Damage

Weapons and Damage comes in four categories:

* Light Damage -- 1d6
* Medium Damage -- 2d6
* Heavy Damage -- 3d6
* Deadly Damage -- 4d6

*eg. light weapons do light damage, deadly weapons do deadly damage.*

The effect level result is added to the damage dice of the weapon.

* Damage is done against the appropriate pool.
* If you sufferd more points than your pool, you enter coma.

### Critical Damage

* On a critical result damage dice are not rolled,
  but effect level directly applied against the crit threshold.

* If you suffered more crit than your threshold, you are hovering on deaths door
  or suffer a permanent disability (gm decides).

#### Optional Critical Damage Chart

TBD. (use d66 ?)

### Damage and Armor

Medieval armor comes in four categories:

* Light Protection -- 1 EL subtracted from damage, -1 Tick in Action Order 
* Medium Protection -- 2 EL subtracted from damage, -2 Ticks in Action Order
* Heavy Protection -- 3 EL subtracted from damage, -4 Ticks in Action Order
* Magical Protection -- see specific description

### Movement

You can move up to half your movement score, expending one action in combat.
Each pace of movement takes one tick.

## Recovery and Healing 

TBD.
