# Alternative Character Development Rules

## Alternative Ability Score Development

The current score is used to determine the DP cost and raise for the ability.

DP Cost = `(score/20) rounded down to a minimum of 1`

Ability Raise = `((99 - score)/20) trunkated to a minimum of 1`

| Current    | DP Cost |
|:---:|:--|
| Up to 19   | 1DP raises the ability score by +4 |
| 20 to 39   | 1DP raises the ability score by +3 |
| 40 to 59   | 2DP raises the ability score by +2 |
| 60 to 79   | 3DP raises the ability score by +1 |
| 80 to 99   | 4DP raises the ability score by +1 |
| 100 to 119 | 5DP raises the ability score by +1 |
| each +20   | +1DP raises the ability score by +1 |


## Proficiency Skill Level Development

You may opt to purchase Level 0 (Proficiency) for 1DP in a Skill instead of Level 1.

Improving from Level 0 to Level 1 still costs the standard cost as per the basic rules.
