### What Is Magic

* Tone: Is magic a neutral force, a flavored force, or something with opinions?
* Cost: Does magic demand a price, a risk, or neither?
* Limits: Does magic follow strict rules? Is it flexible and open-ended? What are the limits on magic?
* Availability: Is magic universally available, so everyone in a setting might have it? Is it rare enough that only some people have it, possibly including all the PCs? Or is it rare enough that only one or two PCs might have access to it?
* Source: Where does magic come from?
