## Making Tests

The test threshold is the skill value plus difficulty modifier(s).
Roll d100 equal to or less than the threshold for success, higher is failure.

| Difficulty   | Modifier | Time Taken             | Ranged Attacks | Alternative Difficulty |
|:-------------|:--------:|:-----------------------|:---------------|:----:|
| Very Easy    |   +40%   | Ten times normal time  |         | -3 |
| Easy         |   +20%   | Five times normal time | Touch   | -2 |
| Simple       |   +10%   | Double normal time     | Reach   | -1 |
| Routine      |    +0%   | Normal time            | Near    |  0 |
| Difficult    |   –10%   | --                     | Far     |  1 |
| Hard         |   –20%   | Half normal time       | Long    |  2 |
| Very Hard    |   –40%   | --                     | Extreme |  3 |
| Formidable   |   –60%   | Almost instantly       |         |  4 |

* A pair (11,22,...,99,00) is a critical indicator.
* A "00" is always a critical fumble.
* if successful, the positive effect level (if needed) is equal to the "tens" of the roll.
* if unsuccessful, the negative effect level (if needed) is equal to the "ones" of the roll.

### Alternative Difficulty (Optional Rule)

The test threshold is the skill value. Roll d100 and establish an effect level as per normal rules.
Score at least an effect level equal or greater than the alternative difficulty for success.

The final effect level is the difference from the alternative difficulty.

*Example:* the pc rolls and scores an effect level of 4 for a Difficult task -- the final effect level is 3 and the task is successful.

### Rolling at Advantage or Disadvantage

Some abilities or situations (the gm has the final say), allows making the test at Advantage or Disadvantge.

Multiple cases of Advantage or Disadvantage eleminate each other until only Advantage, Disadvantage or none remain.

* Advantage -- after the roll, you may assign the highest and lowest die value to the ones and tens as you see fit.
* Disadvantage -- after the roll the lowest die is taken as the ones and the highest die as the tens value.


### Contests

Each side make its roll, the side with the "more positive" effect level wins.

* On a tie compare skills.
* On again a tie GM decides

The final effect level of a contest is the difference of the effect levels.

## Combat

A combat round has 6 seconds length.

### Initiative and Action Order

Roll Initiative Scores, highest result (tick) acts first, additional actions start 2 ticks later each.

This action order usually persists for the entire encounter, unless the gm decides otherwise.

### Melee or Skirmishing Combat Contest

Roll your combat skill as you would for a contest.

If the defender is not in the position to actively defend, he needs to substitute Reaction instead.

If the defender is not in the position to passively defend (restrained), his effect level is zero.

Note: this could mean that an unlucky attacker can damage itself even given a restrained defender.

### Ranged Attack Tests

Roll your combat skill as you would for a test, using the applicable range modifiers from the table.

### Weapons and Damage

Weapons and Damage comes in four categories:

* Light Damage -- 1d6
* Medium Damage -- 2d6
* Heavy Damage -- 3d6
* Deadly Damage -- 4d6

*eg. light weapons do light damage, deadly weapons do deadly damage.*

The effect level result is added to the damage dice of the weapon.

* Damage is done against the appropriate pool.
* If you suffered more points than your pool, you enter coma.

### Damage Types

* Burning/Fire/Heat
* Corrosive/Acid
* Crushing/Grapple/Entangle
* Energy/Blaster/Laser
* Freezing/Cold/Ice
* Necroti/Unholyc/Disruption
* Piercing/Puncture
* Poison
* Psychic/Stress
* Radiant/Holy
* Radiation
* Shocking/Stun/Lightning
* Slashing
* Sonic/Thunder

### Immunity, Vulnerability, etc.

* Immunity -- means you take no damage from the damage type.
* Resistance -- means you only take half damage from the damage type.
* Vulnerability -- means you take double damage from the damage type.

* Protection (X) -- means you ignore X effect level (or damage dice) from the damage type.
* Susceptibility (X) -- means you actually add X effect level (or damage dice) from the damage type.

### Critical Damage

* On a critical result damage dice are not rolled,
  but effect level directly applied against the crit threshold.

* If you suffered more crit than your threshold, you are hovering on deaths door
  or suffer a permanent disability (gm decides).

* any overflow crit converts to aggravated crit.
  
* Each crit suffered adds a -10% to skill rolls,
  or reduces scored effect levels 1:1
  in the relevant category (GM decides).

#### Critical Damage Chart (Optional Rule)

TBD. (use d66 ?)

### Damage and Armor

Medieval armor comes in four categories:

* Light Protection -- 1d subtracted from damage, -1 Tick in Action Order 
* Medium Protection -- 2d subtracted from damage, -3 Ticks in Action Order
* Heavy Protection -- 3d subtracted from damage, -5 Ticks in Action Order, max Actions 2 per round.
* Magical Protection -- see specific description

### Movement

You can move up to half your movement score, expending one action in combat.
Each pace of movement takes one tick.
