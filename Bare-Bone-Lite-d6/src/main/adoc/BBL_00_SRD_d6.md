## Making Tests

You basically roll a number of d6 and count the number of successes. 

* for un-proficient skills, a 4,5 or 6 counts as a success.
* for proficient skills, a 6 counts as two successes.

The number of successes after subtracting the difficulty is called the effect level.

| Difficulty   | Modifier | Time Taken             | Ranged Attacks |
|:-------------|:--------:|:-----------------------|:---------------|
| Very Easy    |    0     | Ten times normal time  |         |
| Easy         |    1     | Five times normal time | Touch   |
| Simple       |    2     | Double normal time     | Reach   |
| Routine      |    3     | Normal time            | Near    |
| Difficult    |    4     | --                     | Far     |
| Hard         |    5     | Half normal time       | Long    |
| Very Hard    |    6     | Quarter normal time    | Extreme |
| Formidable   |    7     | Almost instantly       |         |

* A pair (11,22,...,66) is a boon indicator.
* A triple (111,222,...,666) is a critical indicator.

### Assembling the Dice Pool

A dice pool is usually assembled from the sum of the applicable attribute and skill values.

*The GM may rule to use a specific combination of multiple skills and/or attributes.*

### Rolling at Advantage or Disadvantage

Some abilities or situations (the gm has the final say), allows making the test at Advantage or Disadvantage.

Multiple cases of Advantage or Disadvantage eleminate each other until only Advantage, Disadvantage or none remain.

**Advantage**

* Rolling with Advantage means that also a 3 counts as a success.
* Rolling with Double Advantage means that also a 2 counts as a success.

**Disadvantage** 

* Rolling with Disadvantage means that a 4 does not count as a success.
* Rolling with Double Disadvantage means that a 5 does not count as a success.

### Contests

Each side make its roll, the side with the "greater" effect level wins.

* On a tie compare if a side has advantage and/or disadvantage.
* On again a tie compare skills.
* On again a tie GM decides.

The final effect level of a contest is the difference of the effect levels.

## Combat

A combat round has 6 seconds length.

### Initiative and Action Order

Roll Initiative Scores, highest result (tick) acts first, additional actions start 2 ticks later each.

This action order usually persists for the entire encounter, unless the gm decides otherwise.

### Melee or Skirmishing Combat Contest

Roll your combat skill as you would for a contest.

If the defender is not in the position to actively defend, he needs to substitute Reaction instead.

If the defender is not in the position to passively defend (restrained), his effect level is zero.

Note: this could mean that an unlucky attacker can damage itself even given a restrained defender.

### Ranged Attack Tests

Roll your combat skill as you would for a test, using the applicable range modifiers from the table.

### Weapons and Damage

Weapons and Damage comes in four categories:

* Light Damage -- 1d6
* Medium Damage -- 2d6
* Heavy Damage -- 3d6
* Deadly Damage -- 4d6

*eg. light weapons do light damage, deadly weapons do deadly damage.*

The effect level result is added to the damage dice of the weapon.

* Damage is done against the appropriate pool.
* If you suffered more points than your pool, you enter coma.

### Damage Types (Optional Rule)

#### Immunity, Vulnerability, etc.

* Immunity -- means you take no damage from the damage type at all.
* Resistance -- means you only take half damage from the damage type, 
    and critical damage is converted to normal damage.
* Vulnerability -- means damage is converted to critical for the damage type,
    and critical damage is doubled.

* Protection -- works like resistance, but aggravated is treated as normal damage.  
* Susceptibility -- works like vulnerability, but normal damage is treated as aggravated.

#### Non-aggravated Damage Types

* Crushing/Force
* Grapple/Entangle
* Bludgeoning
* Piercing/Puncture
* Psychic/Stress
* Slashing
* Sonic/Thunder
* Poison
* Shocking/Stun

#### Aggravated Damage Types

* Burning/Fire/Heat
* Corrosive/Acid
* Energy/Blaster/Laser
* Freezing/Cold/Ice
* Necrotic/Unholy/Disruption
* Radiant/Holy
* Radiation
* Lightning

### Critical Damage

* On a critical result damage dice are not rolled,
  but effect level directly applied against the crit threshold.

* If you suffered more crit than your threshold, you are hovering on deaths door
  or suffer a permanent disability (gm decides).

* any overflow crit converts to aggravated crit.
  
* Each crit suffered adds a -1d to skill rolls,
  or reduces scored effect levels 1:1
  in the relevant category (GM decides).

#### Critical Damage Types and Conditions (Optional Rule)
 
* Staggered --
* Prone --
* Blinded --
* Immobilized --
* Disoriented --
* Bleeding (N) -- the target suffers N wound(s) each round, due to blood loss.

* Medium Protection -- 2d subtracted from damage, -3 Ticks in Action Order
* Heavy Protection -- 3d subtracted from damage, -5 Ticks in Action Order, max Actions 2 per round.
* Magical Protection -- see specific description

A shield increases Protection by one step (ie. 1d).

### Movement

You can move up to half your movement score, expending one action in combat.
Each pace of movement takes one tick.

## Recovery and Healing

eating, drinking, reading, and tending wounds.
